To do: 
1) Get Heroku up and running with hello world.
    a) Create index.js that will require our server code and execute and start the http server
        https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs
    b) Create a Procfile file so that we can point web=index.js 
        http://www.nodebeginner.org/#a-full-blown-web-application-with-nodejs
    c) Create simple hello world where it spits out html onto the page.

2) Figure out how to easier build HTML elements in node.js
    a) Research node.js add-ons to include so that we can easier build HTML dynamically. Building a long string with
       html components works for now but we should think about how to better integrate an add-on to help facilitate
       these html elements

3) Figure out what HTML/CSS framework to use so that it's a RWD.  
    a) I was using Foundation which I found to be pretty slick.  It works well with RWD and offers pre-built templates. 
    b) Bootstrap? It looks really slick. 
    c) Need to consider that any RWD CSS/JS framework available current is all client side dom manipulation
    
4) Figure out a way to render HTML on the server to lighten the load on client-side DOM maniupulation. 
    a) If we use a client side RWD framework then that will be taxing on the client. We can't afford to do both DOM 
       manipulation and RWD manipulation on the client.
    a) I want our website to be fast.  Performing DOM manipulating on the client is too expensive. 
    b) Explore angular capabilities on how to render what we need on the server then we can style on the client
    c) Does node.js javascript use the client for cheerio manipulations? I'm not sure. We need to find out
